# Email Scraper & Validator

## Overview

This is a Python-based web application built with Streamlit that provides comprehensive email scraping and validation capabilities. The application allows users to extract email addresses from websites and validate them using multiple verification methods including format validation, DNS checking, and SMTP verification.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

The application follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

### Frontend Architecture
- **Streamlit-based UI**: Web interface built with Streamlit providing an interactive dashboard
- **Multi-tab interface**: Organized into three main sections - Email Scraping, Email Validation, and Results & Export
- **Real-time feedback**: Progress indicators and session state management for user interaction
- **Sidebar configuration**: Centralized settings panel for rate limiting and validation options

### Backend Architecture
- **Modular Python components**: Separate classes for scraping (`EmailScraper`) and validation (`EmailValidator`)
- **Session-based state management**: Streamlit session state for maintaining data across user interactions
- **Utility functions**: Helper functions for data export and rate limiting

## Key Components

### 1. EmailScraper Class
- **Purpose**: Extracts email addresses from web pages
- **Key features**: 
  - BeautifulSoup and Trafilatura for content extraction
  - Regex-based email pattern matching (RFC 5322 compliant)
  - Rate limiting with configurable delays
  - Contact page discovery and crawling
  - False positive filtering

### 2. EmailValidator Class
- **Purpose**: Validates extracted email addresses through multiple verification layers
- **Validation methods**:
  - Format validation (RFC 5322 compliance)
  - Blacklist checking against disposable email providers
  - DNS MX record verification
  - Optional SMTP verification
- **Configurable timeouts** and SMTP checking toggle

### 3. Utility Functions
- **CSV Export**: Converts validation results to downloadable CSV format
- **Rate Limiting**: Decorator for controlling request frequency

### 4. Main Application (app.py)
- **Streamlit interface**: Multi-tab UI with configuration sidebar
- **Session state management**: Persistent data storage across user sessions
- **Progress tracking**: Real-time status updates during scraping/validation operations

## Data Flow

1. **User Input**: User provides website URLs and configuration settings
2. **Email Scraping**: EmailScraper crawls specified websites and extracts email addresses
3. **Data Storage**: Scraped emails stored in Streamlit session state
4. **Email Validation**: EmailValidator processes scraped emails through multiple validation layers
5. **Results Display**: Validated results presented in tabular format with export options
6. **Data Export**: Results can be exported as CSV files for external use

## External Dependencies

### Core Libraries
- **Streamlit**: Web application framework for the user interface
- **Requests**: HTTP client for web scraping and API calls
- **BeautifulSoup4**: HTML parsing for email extraction
- **Trafilatura**: Advanced web content extraction
- **pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **dnspython**: DNS resolution for MX record validation

### Network Services
- **DNS Servers**: For MX record validation
- **SMTP Servers**: For optional email deliverability testing
- **Target Websites**: External websites being scraped for email addresses

## Deployment Strategy

### Current Setup
- **Local Development**: Designed to run locally using Streamlit's development server
- **File-based Storage**: Uses Streamlit session state for temporary data storage
- **No Database**: Currently operates without persistent data storage

### Architecture Decisions

1. **Streamlit Choice**: 
   - **Problem**: Need for rapid prototyping of web interface
   - **Solution**: Streamlit for quick UI development
   - **Pros**: Fast development, built-in components, Python-native
   - **Cons**: Limited customization, session-based state only

2. **Modular Class Design**:
   - **Problem**: Separation of scraping and validation logic
   - **Solution**: Separate EmailScraper and EmailValidator classes
   - **Pros**: Maintainable, testable, reusable components
   - **Cons**: Additional complexity for simple operations

3. **Multi-layer Validation**:
   - **Problem**: Need for comprehensive email verification
   - **Solution**: Progressive validation (format → DNS → SMTP)
   - **Pros**: High accuracy, configurable depth
   - **Cons**: Slower processing, potential for false negatives

4. **Session State Storage**:
   - **Problem**: Need to maintain data across user interactions
   - **Solution**: Streamlit session state for temporary storage
   - **Pros**: Simple implementation, no database setup required
   - **Cons**: Data lost on session end, no persistence across deployments

5. **Rate Limiting Implementation**:
   - **Problem**: Need to respect target websites and avoid blocking
   - **Solution**: Configurable delays and request limits
   - **Pros**: Ethical scraping, reduced server load
   - **Cons**: Slower data collection

The application is designed for single-user scenarios with temporary data storage, making it suitable for desktop deployment or small-scale cloud hosting without requiring database infrastructure.
